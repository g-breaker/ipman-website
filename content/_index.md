# Welcome
Welcome to my home page. My plan is to fill this page with my technical notes, collecting all my notes in one place. I hope this will help me practise writing as well as boost my learning. As I really didn't know how to structure a webpage, I ended up using this kinda "your basically in my home computer" structure.

#### IPMAN ?
The name comes from the Ip Man karate movies. I'm also really fond of the abriviation IP (Intellectual Property) in electronics, and I think i suits this page well, as this page will contain my intellectual property.
